# ReadingTime-BrowserExtension
The reading time for every web page displayed in your browser toolbar

## Usage
Simply install this extension and ensure it is visible in your Chrome toolbar. As you browse the web, the icon of the extension will display a number. This will reflect the number of minutes that the current page will take to read. By default the time is calculated using the average 275 words per minute reading speed.

## Config
To configure this extension, simply access the 'options' page by right-clicking the icon in your browser toolbar. Here you can alter reading speed and icon text color. The latter is especially useful if the icon is difficult to read on your Chrome theme.

## TO-DO
- Investigate reading time for a page changing when going back and forth between tabs
- Improve options page CSS
