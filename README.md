This browser extension displays the reading time of the users current web page.

With so much content on the web, nobody has time to read it all. Instant Reading Time uses your own reading speed to calculate the amount of minutes it will take for you to read the current page. 

Unlike other extensions, the number is displayed as a non-intrusive icon in your browser toolbar. It doesn't interfere with your user experience at all.

## Usage
Simply install this extension and ensure it is visible in your Chrome toolbar. As you browse the web, the icon of the extension will display a number. This will reflect the number of minutes that the current page will take to read. By default the time is calculated using the average 275 words per minute reading speed.

## Config
To configure this extension, simply access the 'options' page by right-clicking the icon in your browser toolbar. Here you can alter reading speed and icon text color. The latter is especially useful if the icon is difficult to read on your Chrome theme.

## Download
This extension is available on the Chrome store.
