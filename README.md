# ReadingTime-BrowserExtension
The reading time for every web page displayed in your browser toolbar


## TO-DO
- Display reading time on Chrome badge (as content script cannot access this API it requires messaging a background script)
- Consider altering icon via canvas instead of using badge text (this allows the badge text to be positioned at the top and other text (e.g. 'mins) to be positioned at bottom) See [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15217763/how-to-set-text-at-top-of-chrome-extension-icon)
- Add option to change WPM reading time
