# ReadingTime-BrowserExtension
The reading time for every web page displayed in your browser toolbar


## TO-DO
- Reset the badge text every time a user changes tab or goes back/forward etc not just when page is reloaded
- Consider altering icon via canvas instead of using badge text (this allows the badge text to be positioned at the top and other text (e.g. 'mins) to be positioned at bottom) See [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15217763/how-to-set-text-at-top-of-chrome-extension-icon)
- Add option to change WPM reading time
